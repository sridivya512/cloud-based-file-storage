# Cloud-Based File Storage Application

The Cloud-Based File Storage application allows users to securely upload, download, and manage their files from any device with internet access. Built with React for the front end, the application integrates Firebase Authentication for secure user login and AWS S3 for scalable file storage. Each user gets a unique folder in the AWS S3 bucket, ensuring data privacy and security. The application uses AWS CloudFront for fast and secure content delivery, providing an optimized user experience globally.
